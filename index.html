We're creating simple, sustainable solutions that transform how we think about technology and its impact on our planet.</p> <h2>Our Vision</h2> <p>Our goal is to bring sustainability to the forefront of the tech industry. We believe that the digital world and the natural world can coexist harmoniously, and we're developing the tools to make that a reality.</p> <h2>Our Project</h2> <p>We're building a tool that measures the carbon impact of software - right from the initial stages of development. This means engineers can see the environmental footprint of their code before it ever goes live, helping them make more eco-friendly design choices.</p> <h2>Why It Matters</h2> <p>Just like physical waste, digital waste has an impact on our environment. By tracking and reducing the carbon footprint of software, we can make a significant contribution to waste reduction, leading to a cleaner, greener planet.</p> <h2>Stay Informed</h2> <p>Want to know more?
